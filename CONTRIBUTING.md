## Development

### Prerequisites

#### Install Pixi

Pixi is used in this project to manage dependencies and environments and to set
up some convenient ways to run code and tools within those environments.

To get started, install [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) using either the
[instructions on their website](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation), or the
commands below:

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Configure pre-commit

PRs will fail style and formatting checks as configured by
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), but you can set up your local repository
such that precommit runs every time you commit. This way, you can fix any errors
before you send out pull requests!

#### Configure pre-commit to run on every commit

Then, once Pixi is installed, run the following command to set up pre-commit
checks on every commit

```
pixi run pre-commit-install
```

#### Manually run pre-commit on non-committed files

```
pixi run pre-commit
```

#### Manually run pre-commit on all files

```
pixi run pre-commit-all
```
