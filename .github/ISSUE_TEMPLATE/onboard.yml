        ## Welcome to the project!

        We're excited to have you on board! This issue is designed to help you get started
        with contributing to our project. Please follow the steps below to set up your development
        environment and familiarize yourself with the project.

        Not following these steps may result in errors when trying to run or contribute code
        later on down the line.

        ### Onboarding checklist

        Instructions for the following steps are provided below. Please check them off as you complete them!

        - [ ] Pixi installed
        - [ ] Onboarding run successfully
        - [ ] First PR opened

        ### Pre-requisites

        #### Install Pixi!

        Pixi is used in this project to manage dependencies and environments and to set
        up some convenient ways to run code and tools within those environments.

        To get started, install [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) using either the
        [instructions on their website](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation), or the
        commands below:

        **macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
        ```

        **Windows:**

        ```powershell
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
        ```

        (These steps are also available in CONTRIBUTING.md if you need to set up on a new machine later)

        ### Onboarding Steps

        - [ ] Clone the repository and navigate into it
        - [ ] Run the following command to set up your environment, install dependencies and get the project ready to go

          ```bash
          pixi run onboard
          ```

        - [ ] Validate that the all steps have been completed by making your first commit and first pull request!

        ```bash
        git checkout -b onboarding-<your-name>
        git add --update
        git commit --message "chore: complete onboarding for <your-name>"
        gh pr create --title "Onboarding: <your-name>" --body "This is my first PR!" --label "onboarding" --web
        ```
